# CAMP Project Proposal

## Team Members
- Dennis Lustre
- Keisun Luc
- Ziyang Cheng

## Programming Platform
- Max -> VST. Also open to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) + [nih_plug](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug) if it proves to be a better option.

## Product Goal/Purpose
A Tape Saturator VST that emulates the magnetic hysteresis of a tape machine. The effect will be applied to the signal, and the user will be able to control the amount of saturation, the dry/wet mix, and the input and output volume.

## Anticipated Result
A VST that applies a tape saturation effect to the signal, with a user interface that allows the user to control the parameters of the effect.

## User Interaction
Users can turn various knobs to control Dry/Wet, input & output volume, and saturation amount.

## Timeline
1. Successfully get a basic VST exported which successfully integrates with a DAW (export from Max or Rust + nih_plug, then try importing VST to FL Studio or other DAW).
2. Conceptualize & finalize audio processing logic (signal -> Discretized Jiles-Atherton Model -> output signal).
3. Implement minimum-viable-product VST (barebones UI, just basic functionality like sliders to change the parameters).
4. Conceptualize & implement a better UI.
5. Prepare a presentation and present the current product (Tuesday, March 12 at 2:00 pm).
6. Fix remaining issues and add finishing touches.
7. Write documentation/user manual and turn in our deliverables (Thursday, March 21 at 3:30 pm).

## Knowledge to Acquire
- How to emulate Magnetic Hysteresis (discretized [Jiles-Atherton Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiles%E2%80%93Atherton_model), [An Improved Jiles-Atherton Model for Least Square Identification using Sensitivity Function Normalization](https://www.lias-lab.fr/~eriketien/Files/Other/An%20Improved%20Jiles-Atherton%20Model%20for%20Least%20Square.pdf)).
- How to successfully export and integrate a VST to a DAW.
- How to create a UI for VST.
- How to write a user manual for a VST.

## Notes
- The process of making discretized Jiles-Atherton may prove difficult.
